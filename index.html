        <h1>The Amplitudes</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="stdP">Sneaking suspicion that wherever I go, whatever I do, I’m killing millions of tiny organisms.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="stdP">A pamphlet they give us in school says that hot water kills more germs than cold. I start washing my hands with cold water.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="stdP">They haven't told me about the sinusoids. The little waves in the air, the vibrations that become sound. How the sun moves, that's how sound moves. Up and down in circular motion, multiplied out along the harmonics possibly infinitely, smaller and smaller. According to its law, complexity of sound is its density, on a spectrum from a monophonic vibrating glass to a white noise waterfall.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="stdP">I assume they exist and my assumptions make them up.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="stdP">“Unfortunately, a signal’s amplitude has no one canonical definition. Strictly speaking, all the samples in a digital audio signal are themselves amplitudes,”    <a class="superscript" target="_blank" href="http://msp.ucsd.edu/techniques/latest/book.pdf#page=15">1</a> they go along the grain both ways, with a wave-like nature and a grid-like structure. Not all sound, but recorded sound, represented sound. It must be broken up into parts so small they disappear.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="stdP">So small, and out of reach. General amplitude offered up to you in its place, the ratio-unit of decibels, click it up or down in your pocket. How it feels wrong to interfere with its course, pushing the waves around, shrinking them, expanding them to suit your will. </p>
        <br>
        <p class="stdP">It’s always bothered me some people’s insistence on keeping TV volume on a round number, rather than judging the loudness itself. But then I’m no better, because I’ll leave the volume at 39 just to make them squirm, the same movement that the amplitude performs for us.</p>
